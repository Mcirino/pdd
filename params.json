  "body": "### Welcome to PaleoDeepDive\r\nThe PaleoDeepDive statistical machine reading and learning system was developed to extract paleontological data from scientific literature, ie. dark data. [DeepDive](https://web.stanford.edu/~netj/tmp/deepdive/) is the base of PaleoDeepDive. DeepDive is a trained system, which means it learns and gets better with repeated iterations and more data. PaleoDeepDive is a variant of DeepDive specializing in extracting data from paleontological literature, and outputting useful fossil data, specifically fossil size data.\r\n\r\n### Using PaleoDeepDive\r\nPaleoDeepDive requires the installaiton of the 0.8.0-alpha version of DeepDive, available [here](https://github.com/HazyResearch/deepdive). \r\nA PaleoDeepDive walkthrough is available [here](todo).",
