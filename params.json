[DeepDive](https://web.stanford.edu/~netj/tmp/deepdive/) is the base of PDD. DeepDive is a trained system, which means it learns and gets better with repeated iterations and more data. PDD is a variant of DeepDive specializing in extracting data from paleontological literature, and outputting useful fossil data, specifically fossil size data.",
